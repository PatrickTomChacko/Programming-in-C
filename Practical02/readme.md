Practical02 consists of two pieces of code
1. "Conversion.c"
To run this code use:
> gcc -o conversion conversion.c

> ./conversion

  The expected output is the integer number and it's binary converted representation

2. "sum.c"
To run this code use:
> gcc -o sum sum.c

> ./sum

  The expected output is the difference between two sums calculated differently. 
  The first sum is calculated using an incremental loop, and the second using a decremental one.

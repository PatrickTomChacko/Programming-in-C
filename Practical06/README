This week consists of two files:
1. main.c
2. matmul.c


main.c consists the main body of the code where the matrices are initialized and printed.
matmul.c consists strictly of the function doing the multiplicaiton on the initialized matrices.

To run these files together:
>> gcc -c main.c
// This will create a main.o file
>> gcc -c matmul.c
// This will create matmul.o file
>> gcc -o matmul main.0 matmul.o
>>./matmul
This will run main.c using matmul.c

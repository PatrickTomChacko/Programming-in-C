Practical09 has code for Magic Square recognition

to run the code use: 

> gcc -o main main.c

> ./main

This code will be run only if the header file is also accessible in the same directory as main.c
The input matrix to be tested is stored in the "square.txt" file

Once the code is run, it will print the number of lines in the matrix and whether or not it is a magic square

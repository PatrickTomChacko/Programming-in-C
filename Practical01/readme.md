There are two files in practical01
1. printing.c 
This file can be run using 
>> gcc -o print printing.c
The expected output is an integer and two float numbers rounded off to the 2nd decimal position


2. scanning.c
This file can be run using
>> gcc -o scan scanning.c
The expected output is that the code will ask you to enter two positive numbers.
It will then tell you if the two numbers you entered were odd or even

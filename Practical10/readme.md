Practical10 consists of the code for "Tower of Hanoi"

to run this code use:
> gcc -c hanoi.c

> gcc -c main.c

> gcc -o main main.o hanoi.o


Inside the "main.c" integer "h" has been set to 6, which solved the tower of Hanoi for 6 discs.
This can be modified based on the number of discs, by changing the value of h in main.c.

On running the code, we will see the output of how to move the discs from tower 1, 2 and 3.

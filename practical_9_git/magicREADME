In this program we are checking whether a given matrix is magic Square or not.  If the rows, columns, diagonal add upto the same number then the matrix is called magic. In this program we have included a header file declared by us and linked it to the main file. Program asks the user to enter a filename and the program reads the elements in the file, dynamically allocates memory for it, prints if it is magic or not and finally frees up the allocatted space. 

Big Theta notation as we can see here will be a function of n^2 where n is the size of matrix, it will have n*n elements.
